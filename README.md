#  My resume in GatsbyJS

This repo has the structure to create a site with your resume, and it's easy to customize since a set `yml` files drive it.


1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. 
    
1. **Edit you resume information**
